Really helps me to remember all complex github combination, it also released by github education so it can be trusted for it completeness.

2. [Shell Cheatsheet](https://oit.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Linux_bash_cheat_sheet-1.pdf)</br>
Another cheatsheet, but this one for shell command as it is really complex and you def need more references to help you.
